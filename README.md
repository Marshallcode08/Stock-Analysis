# Stock-Analysis
VBA Project
Ryan Marshall

**Overview of the project**
  The purpose of this project is to grab specific set of data for a financial analysis utilizing my VBA skills. Steve wanted us to first pull data from a specific stock with a ticker "DQ" so we can see can show the data result of that ticker. VBA is really good at setting macro that allows you to pull the data you want to show. When the data came back and we colored code a "loss" red, we discovered that ticker "DQ" might not have been a good stock to invest in. In response to the results of the DQ analysis sheet, we decided to look at multiple ticker to see if we can see a better investment. The purpose of the challenge is for display our ability to code the worksheets to display data we want to use for our analysis.
  
**Results of the Analysis**

   The pictures shows the results of all the tickers from 2018 using the original macro we created. It shows that two tickers show growth on the     return on investment showing above an 80% growth in 2018.

The second pictures is where we ran the code and got the same results because in the first picture we ran the code with if then statements with a nested statement inside picking anc choosing data that will give us the data that is shown in the picture. The picture listed below will show the nested if then statement.

  The second picture is when we calculate the starting price and the ending price and create an if then statement that will display the data and the data shows very similar, which will be shown in the picture below.

The snip of the code I used is just a snip it of each different macro

**Summary**
  I will speak of my own experience one of the biggest advantages that I can speak on regarding refactoring code is it showed me that there are multiple ways to "skin a cow". I basically wrote the same code, but in two different ways using different methods. Now I know how flexible, but concise VBA is and it has prepared to understand coding in other enviroment. The biggest disadvantage it is hard to see and get the same results. It seems you need extensive knowledge to be able to do this.
  The pros is helps you understand your code because there is no better way to show you have knowledge to something then to have multiple ways for you to show you work. The con is not really a con, but rather a challenge that backs up the pro of refactoring VBA script. It seems to me once you know it and have a firm understanding you can do whatever you want the difficulty is how precise the everything is and you must be knowledgeable with the program.
